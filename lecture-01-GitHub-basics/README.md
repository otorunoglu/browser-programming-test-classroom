# Assignment 2 – Semantic Portfolio Page

## 1. Overview
This repository contains my solution for **Assignment 2 – Semantic Portfolio Page**.

The goal of this assignment is to design a portfolio page using **semantic HTML**, focusing on structure and meaning rather than visual design.

## 2. Semantic Elements Used and Reasons

Describe the semantic HTML elements you used and **why** you chose them.

Example:
- `<header>` – used for introductory content and page identity
- `<main>` – contains the primary content of the page
- `<article>` – used for individual portfolio items

(Write 3–6 bullet points.)

## 3. Page Structure Explanation

Answer briefly:
- What is the role of `header`, `main`, and `footer` in your page?
- How does your page structure help readability and accessibility?

## 4. Heading Hierarchy

Describe your heading structure:
- Where is `h1` used?
- How are `h2` and `h3` used?
- Why is the hierarchy logical?

## 5. AI Tool Usage (If Applicable)

If you used AI tools, describe clearly:

- Which tool(s) you used
- What the AI generated initially
- What **you changed afterwards** (minimum 3 concrete changes)

If you did not use AI, state that clearly.

## 6. Self-Evaluation

Briefly reflect:
- What part of semantic HTML was easiest for you?
- What was most difficult?
